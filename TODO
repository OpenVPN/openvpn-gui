TODOs for OpenVPN-GUI

* support usernames and passwords that contain a " character

* pass string length to IDS_NFO_CONNECTION_XXX
* move registry values below openvpn pregistry key
* convert boolean registry values from string to dword
* maybe parse config and use selected options in command line directly
* have some kind of error log instead of message boxes for low level errors
