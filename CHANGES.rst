---------

There was a bug in the code that expands variables in
registry values. If the expanded string was longer than
the original string it got incorrectly truncated.


Version 1.0.2 (2005-07-27)
==========================

Pass paths read in OpenVPN GUI's registry values through
ExpandEnvironmentStrings(). This allows the use of Windows
variables like %HOMEPATH% or %PROGRAMFILES%. This allows
multiple users on the same system to have their own set
of config files and keys in their home dir.


Version 1.0.1 (2005-06-10)
==========================

Bug Fixes
---------

The Change Password feature did not work correctly when TABs
were used in the config file between the key/pkcs12 keyword and
the accual path to the key file.


Version 1.0 (2005-04-21)
========================

No changes

Version 1.0-rc5 (2005-03-29)
============================

Bug Fixes
---------

[Pre/Dis]Connect scripts were not executed when starting or stopping
the OpenVPN Service, or using "Service Only" mode.


Version 1.0-rc4 (2005-02-17)
============================

Increased the width of buttons and space between text labels and edit
controls on dialogs to ease localization of OpenVPN GUI.

Bug Fixes
---------

Some fixed text strings was introduced in the code in 1.0-rc3. These
are moved to the resource file now to allow localization.

If starting the OpenVPN service failed, OpenVPN GUI would get
stuck with a yellow icon.


Version 1.0-rc3 (2005-02-14)
============================

New Features
------------

New registry value (show_balloon) to control whether to show the
"Connected Balloon" or not. show_ballon can have the following values
  
0=Never show any balloon. 
1=Show balloon when the connection establishes (default).
2=Show balloon every time OpenVPN has reconnected (old behavior).

Show "Connected since: XXX" and "Assigned IP: X.X.X.X" in the tray
icon tip msg.

If a batch file named xxx_pre.bat exists in the config folder, where
xxx is the same name as an OpenVPN config file, this will be executed
before OpenVPN is launced.

If a batch file named xxx_down.bat exists in the config folder, where
xxx is the same name as an OpenVPN config file, this will be executed
on disconnect, but before the OpenVPN tunnel is closed.

Registry value "show_script_window" controls whether _up, _down and
_pre scripts should execute in the background or in a visible cmd-line
window.

Registry value "[pre/dis]connectscript_timeout" controls how long to
wait for each script to finish.

Updated information on the about dialog.

Bug Fixes
---------

Removed unused code that tried to determine the path to "Program 
Files". This code caused an error in some rare occasions.


Version 1.0-rc2 (2005-01-12)
============================

New Features
------------

Support for one level of subdirectories below the config directory.
This means that if you have multiple connections, you can now put
them in a seperate subdirectory together with their keys and certs.

"Service Only" mode. This is a mode that makes OpenVPN GUI more
friendly to use for non-admin users to control the OpenVPN Service.
Enable this mode by setting the registry value "service_only" to "1".

In this mode the following happends:

- The normal "Connect", "Disconnect" and "Show Status" is removed.
- The Service menu items "Start", "Stop" and "Restart" is replaced 
  by "Connect", "Disconnect" and "Reconnect" directly on the main
  menu. These now control the OpenVPN Service instead.
- Dubbleclicking the icon starts the OpenVPN Service.
- Dubbleclicking the icon when the service is running brings up a
  dialog asking if you want to disconnect.
- The Proxy Settings menu item is removed as it can't control the service
  anyway.
- The "OpenVPN Service started" dialog msg is replaced with a balloon msg.
- Ask the user if he really wants to exit OpenVPN GUI if the OpenVPN Service is 
  running.
    
Bug Fixes
---------

Full rights were required to control the OpenVPN Service. Now only
Start/Stop permissions are required, which allows a normal user to
control the OpenVPN Service if these rights are granted to the user.
(Can be done with subinacl.exe from the resource kit)

When passwords were retrieved from a user, OpenVPN GUI received them
in the default windows codepage (ISO 8859-1 on english XP), and this 
was passed on untouched to OpenVPN. When OpenVPN is run from command-
line on the other hand, the old DOS CP850 codepage is used. This
caused passwords containing non-ASCII (7-bit) chars that worked from
cmd-line not to work from OpenVPN GUI. This is now solved by
retrieving passwords in unicode and translate them to CP850 before
supplying them to OpenVPN.

Re-scan the config dir for new files when dubble-clicking the tray
icon.


Version 1.0-rc1 (2005-01-06)
============================

New Features
------------

Show a warning message if "log" or "log-append" is found in the config
file.

Bug Fixes
---------

Added a bunch of compiler warnings which revealed a lot of minor
programming errors. Mostly cast conversion errors between signed and
unsigned intergers. All fixed now.

Set focus on the log window when the status window is re-opened to make
sure the log is scrolled automatically.

Set focus on the log window when clicking disconnect to allow the log
to continue scrolling automatically until OpenVPN is terminated.

===============================

New Features
------------

Show "Connecting to: xxx" msg in tray icon tip message in addition to
the previously displayed "Connected to:" msg.

Bug Fixes
---------

Don't ask if you are sure you want to change your password to an EMPTY
password if you're not allowed to use passwords shorter than 8 chars.

Clear password buffers after use to avoid having passwords in memory.

  
Version 1.0-beta25 (2004-12-01)
===============================

Changed button labels on the status dialog from DisConnect and ReConnect
to Disconnect and Reconnect.

Don't show "Assigned IP:" at all in the connected balloon if no IP
address is known, as when a real remote DHCP server is used.

Stripped out the last hardcoded strings to the resource file.

Raised maximum number of configs from 20 to 50.

Bug Fixes
---------

If OpenVPN printed a line longer that 1024 chars, OpenVPN GUI would crash.
This could happend when using "verb 5" or higher as OpenVPN then prints
an "r" or "w" for every packet without any line breaks. A new line will
now be inserted when 1024 chars is reached.

Ask if you want to close active connections when WM_CLOSE is received.

Handle WM_QUERYENDSESSION and WM_ENDSESSION correctly by closing any
active connections and then terminate.

Version 1.0-beta24 (2004-11-15)
===============================

Bug Fixes
---------

Some openssl #includes were not #ifdef:ed when building a nochangepsw
version causing the build to fail if the openssl headers were not
available.

When using OpenVPN 1.5/1.6 and entering a false private key passphrase,
OpenVPN GUI would falsely think that the user attempted to start another
connection.

Version 1.0-beta23 (2004-11-08)
===============================

Bug Fixes
---------

Passphrase protected keys stored in MS Certificate Store did not work
due to the way the openvpn console window was hidden.

Version 1.0-beta22 (2004-11-05)
===============================

Bug Fixes
---------

OpenVPN GUI did not pass a CR/LF correctly after supplying OpenVPN
with the private key passphrase! OpenVPN 2.0-beta12 and higher which
uses a new prompt worked, but not earlier versions of OpenVPN.

If the Shell (explorer.exe) is restarted, OpenVPN GUI did not
re-register the tray icon.


Version 1.0-beta21 (2004-10-29)

above feature. 

ReConnect button on the status dialog.

Registry option "allow_proxy" to hide the Proxy Settings menu item.

Registry option "silent_connection" that suppresses the status
dialog from being showed while connecting.

Command-line option to set the time to wait for the connect script
to finish.

Icon color now reflects the status of the OpenVPN Service.

Bug Fixes
---------

Included shellapi.h with the sourcecode, as the one distributed with
the current stable version of MinGW miss some definitions.

When closing OpenVPN GUI it waits for all connections to close before
exiting (Max 5 sec).

Made the password dialog always be on top of other windows.

Fixed a bug that occured if opening the log file for writing failed.
(which happends if you try to run OpenVPN GUI without admin rights)

The menuitems on the OpenVPN Service menu was incorrectly enabled/
disabled. This bug was introduced with beta19 as a result of the
dynamic rescanning for configs on every menu opening.

Starting OpenVPN GUI with OpenVPN 1.5/1.6 installed and OpenVPN
Service running failed with previous versions. (CreateEvent() error)

The installation package did not remove the OpenVPN-GUI registry key
on uninstall.

Removed dependency on libeay32.dll for the no change password build.

Version 1.0-beta19 (2004-09-22)

If no connection is running, the config dir is re-scanned for configs
every time the menu is opened.

If a file exists in the config folder named xxxx_up.bat, where xxxx
is the same name as an existing config file, this batch file will be
executed after a connection has been establish. If the batch file
fails (return an exitcode other than 0), an error message is displayed.

Auto-hide status window after a connection is established and show
a systray info balloon instead.

Show assigned IP address in connected balloon.

Don't allow starting multiple instances of OpenVPN GUI.

Added a cancel button to the Ask Password dialog.

Show an error msg if --connect refers to a non existing config file.

Ignore case of config file extension.

Version 1.0-beta18 (2004-09-13)

start that connection.

Bug Fixes
---------

A bug in the GetRegKey() function caused OpenVPN GUI sometimes to
fail starting with the following error msg:
Error creating exit_event when checking openvpn version.


Version 1.0-beta17 (2004-09-02)
===============================

New Features
------------

A "Hide" button on the status dialog.

Show an error message if the client certificate has expired or is not
yet valid.

Bug Fixes
---------

If OpenVPN was installed in a non default folder, OpenVPN GUI would try
to locate openvpn.exe, log-dir and conf-dir in the default openvpn
folder anyway. Fixed in this version.

OpenVPN GUI tried to check the status of the OpenVPN Service even
if the service menu was disabled in the registry, which caused an
error message to be showed if the service was not installed properly.

Wait for two seconds when exiting OpenVPN GUI, so running openvpn
processes can exit cleanly.

Disable Disconnect menu item while waiting for an openvpn process
to terminate.

Version 1.0-beta11a (2004-08-15)
================================

Bug Fixes
---------

The exit_event handle was not closed after checking the openvpn version
which made it impossible to restart connections with OpenVPN versions 
lower than 2.0-beta6. You received the following msg when trying to
connect a second time:

"I seem to be running as a service, but my exit event object is telling me to exit immediately"

This bug was introduced with OpenVPN GUI v1.0-beta10.

Version 1.0-beta11 (2004-08-09)
===============================

New Features
------------

This version is bundled with a patched version of openvpn that will
output a log message AFTER routes have been added to the system. This
allows the GUI to report "Connected" after this msg. This patch will
be included in next official release of OpenVPN 2.0-beta, so the GUI
will continue to work with future official releases of openvpn. Older
versions of openvpn will still work with this version of OpenVPN GUI,
but "Connected" will then be reported before routes are added as it
did with OpenVPN GUI 1.0-beta10.

If wrong passphrase is entered, openvpn will automatically be restarted
a specified nr of times (default 3), which allows the user to re-enter
his passphrase.

Number of passphase attempts to allow can be specified with reg-key 
"passphrase_attempts" or cmd-line option with the same name.

Bug Fixes
---------

An empty line was printed in the log when prompting for passphrase.
 
Version 1.0-beta10 (2004-08-08)
===============================

Default registry setting for showing the "Edit Config" menuitem is
changed to "1" (Show it). If a previous version of OpenVPN GUI has
been used, the registry key will of cource not change without manually
changing it.

New Features
------------

Check version of openvpn.exe, so it can support all versions of OpenVPN
without a special build of OpenVPN GUI. Tested with 1.5.0, 1.6.0,
2.0-beta4, 2.0-beta7 and 2.0-beta10. Older versions than 2.0-beta6 still
only support one simultaneous connection though. 

Redirect StdIn/StdOut/StdErr through OpenVPN GUI, so we can pass the
private key passphrase to openvpn without requiring a patched version
of OpenVPN. This also allows OpenVPN GUI to prompt for a passphrase only
when it's needed.

If connecting fails, ask the user if he wants to view the log.

Show a dialog while connecting to allow the user to abort the connection.

Bug Fixes
---------

Disable both "Connect" and "DisConnect" while connecting.

Version 1.0-beta9 (2004-07-23)
==============================

The passphrase support added in v1.5-beta1 has been merched into the v1.0
source so v1.5 does not exist any longer!

New Features
------------

Cmd-line options: 
::

   --connect cnn [nopass]: Autoconnect to "cnn" at startup. If "nopass"
                           is used, no passphrase will be asked for.

   --help                : Show list of cmd-line options.

And all registry settings is now available as cmd-line options:
::

   --exe_path            : Path to openvpn.exe.\n"
   --config_dir          : Path to dir to search for config files in.\n"
   --ext_string          : Extension on config files.\n"
   --log_dir             : Path to dir where log files will be saved.\n"
   --priority_string     : Priority string (See install.txt for more info).\n"
   --append_string       : 1=Append to log file. 0=Truncate logfile.\n"
   --log_viewer          : Path to log viewer.\n"
   --editor              : Path to config editor.\n"
   --allow_edit          : 1=Show Edit Config menu\n"
   --allow_service       : 1=Show Service control menu\n"

Bug Fixes
---------

If the GUI was started from a cmd prompt and no passphrase was given
openvpn.exe would query the user for the passphrase from the console
(which is not showed), so the openvpn process got stuck there.


Version 1.5-beta1 (2004-07-16)
==============================

This version is based on v1.0-beta8.

v1.5 is just a temporary version in wait for the management interface
to OpenVPN. When this is available features added in v1.5 will be
rewritten to use this interface instead in v2.0 of OpenVPN-GUI.

New Features
------------

Support for passphrase protected private keys. OpenVPN-GUI will now
always query the user for a passphrase before connecting. The
passphrase is then supplied to OpenVPN via the --passphrase option.
This requires a patched version of OpenVPN that supports the
--passphrase option. A patched version that supports this is included
in the OpenVPN-GUI v1.5-betaX installation package.

The user will always be asked for a passphrase even if the private
key is not encrypted. This is because the GUI does not know in advance
if the key is encrypted or not. This will be fixed in v2.0 when we
have the management interface ready.


Version v1.0-beta8 (2004-07-16)
===============================

New Features
------------

Tray Icon now shows red/green if any connection is established.

Bug Fixes
---------

If something failed before starting openvpn.exe, exit_event and
log_handle was not closed correctly which could make it impossible
to make any more connections without restarting OpenVPN-GUI.

Version 1.0-beta7 (2004-07-08)
==============================

New Features
------------

A seperate build version supporting OpenVPN v1.5, v1.6 and the
2.0 series before beta6. This version only supports having one
connection running at the same time.

Added an About box.

If there are active connections when "Exit OpenVPN-GUI" is selected,
a "Are you sure you want to exit?" box is displayed.

Bug Fixes
---------

It was not possible to have cmd-line options on the reg-keys
"log_viewer" or "editor". This is now possible.

Version 1.0-beta6 (2004-07-05)
==============================

Bug Fixes
---------

The default values for paths created by beta3, beta4 and beta5 used
hardcoded values for "C:\windows..." and "C:\program files...", which
did not work on some localized Windows versions that is not using
these folders. This is fixed now by getting those pathnames from the
system.

If you have installed beta3-beta5 you need to manualy delete the
whole HKEY_LM\SOFTWARE\OpenVPN-GUI key in the registry. The correct
reg-keys will then be recreated when OpenVPN-GUI is started.

Version 1.0-beta5 (2004-07-04)
==============================

New Features
------------

Menu-commands to Start/Stop/Restart the OpenVPN Service. Enable this
feature by setting the following reg-key to 1:
HKEY_LM\SOFTWARE\OpenVPN-GUI\allow_service

Bug Fixes
---------

v1.0-beta4 always opened the registry with write-access, which made
it imposible to start it without administator rights.

Version 1.0-beta4 (2004-07-04)
==============================

New Features
------------

Menu-command to open a config-file for editing. Enable this feature
by setting the following reg-key to 1: 
HKEY_LM\SOFTWARE\OpenVPN-GUI\allow_edit
 
Version 1.0-beta3 (2004-07-04)
==============================

New Features
------------

Log Viewer. As default OpenVPN-GUI launches Notepad to view the log.
The program used to view the log can be changed with this reg-key:
HKEY_LM\SOFTWARE\OpenVPN-GUI\log-viewer

OpenVPN-GUI now uses its own registry-keys, instead of the same as
the service wrapper uses. It now stores its values under this key:
HKEY_LM\SOFTWARE\OpenVPN-GUI\
If this key does not exist, OpenVPN-GUI will create it with the same
default values as the service-wrapper uses, so if you want to use the
service-wrapper on config-files indepentent of the GUI you should
change the "config-dir" key to another folder.

Version 1.0-beta2 (2004-07-03)
==============================

New Features
------------

Connect/Disconnect now shows a sub-menu so each connection can be 
brought up/down individually.

Upon connect OpenVPN-GUI will wait for 3 seconds and then check if
the openvpn process is still alive and report "Connection successful"
only if this is the case.

OpenVPN-GUI monitors the openvpn processes it has started, and if a
process is terminated before the user has chosen to take it down, this
will be reported to the user.

If no config files is found when OpenVPN-GUI is started, it will
notify the user of this and terminate.

Version 1.0-beta1 (2004-07-02)
==============================

Initial release

Features
--------

Adds itself as a system tray icon.

Menuitem "Connect" - Starts openvpn for all config-files it has found.
